# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

General
### Why JavaScript programming is amazing

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.

### How to run a JavaScript script

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node

### How to create variables and constants

with declarations **var , let, const***

### What are differences between var, const and let
*** var ***
The var declaration is the oldest of all and was used before the ES6 was released. There are associated issues with vardeclarations though. That's why new variable declarations were necessary.
*** let ***
The letdeclaration is the preferred way for variable declaration after the ES6 was released, It is considered as an improvement to the vardeclarations.
*** const ***
The constdeclaration is very similar to letand as the name const says they maintain constant values.
### What are all the data types available in JavaScript

String, number, Boolean, Array and object.

### How to use the if, if ... else statements

Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if ... else statement. For example:
```
let iceCream = 'chocolate';
if(iceCream === 'chocolate') {
  alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');
  
} else {
  alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');
  
}
```
The expression inside the if( ... ) is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the else statement—runs instead.

### How to use comments

The constdeclaration is very similar to letand as the name const says they maintain constant values.
```
/*
Everything in between is a comment.
*/
```
If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:
```
// This is a comment
```

### How to affect values to variables

Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or update) that value by giving it a different value. Try entering the following lines into your console:
```
myName = 'Bob';
myAge = 40;
```

### How to use while and for loops
### How to use break and continue statements

The optional break statement associated with each case clause ensures that the program breaks out of switch once the matched statement is executed, and then continues execution at the statement following switch. If break is omitted, the program continues execution inside the switch statement (and will evaluate the next case, and so on).

### What is a function and how do you use functions

Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.

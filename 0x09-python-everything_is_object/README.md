# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

Since strings are immutable, Python optimizes resources by making two names that refer to the same string value refer to the same object, This is not the case with lists.

## Mutation
Instances of primitive built-in values such as numbers are immutable. The values themselves cannot change over the course of program execution. Lists on the other hand are mutable.
